<h2>About RaiseMe</h2>

<p>The RaiseMe career development effort was founded at the first ShellCon infosec conference in Southern California.  There was so much demand for this kind of service, RaiseMe took on a life of its own.  While ShellCon is an annual conference that takes place in the fall, the RaiseMe arm of ShellCon serves the community year round, by providing career development events at a variety of technology conferences and meetups around the country.  Salute! offerings at RaiseMe events focus on veterans and active duty military involved in the special challenge of re-careering to civilian infosec careers.</p>

<h2>RaiseMe Consulting Services</h2>

<p>One-on-one consultations with our volunteer industry professionals are free to conference attendees and sponsors.  Our goal is to give people at all stages in their careers the tools they need to improve their security  game.  We’ll be your mentors, and we have advice to help with getting the most out of the team you’re already on as well as to help with job hunting.  We’ll also help newcomers who dream of working in infosec sharpen their resumes and interview skills before connecting them with organizations that are in need.  Sign-ups are on site.</p>
